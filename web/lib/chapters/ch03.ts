  intro: "A LangGraph agent is a state machine. You define nodes (LLM calls, tool execution) and edges (conditional routing based on whether the model wants to call a tool or return a final answer). MessagesState tracks the conversation, and ToolNode handles tool dispatch automatically.",
  takeaway: "The agent graph pattern — model node → should_continue → tool node → loop back — is the fundamental architecture of every LangGraph agent. Master this and everything else is an extension.",
